Two types of regular expressions

1. 	Regular Expression--> [0-9]+, \\d
2.  Cucumber Expression  (2017)

Rules:
1. Step def file will be generating cucumber expression by default.
2. But you can use regular expression also in step def file.
3. You can mix both regular and cucumber expression in step def file
4. but you can not mix both expression in a step definition method.

{String}, {int}, {Integer}, {float} --> cucumber expression
